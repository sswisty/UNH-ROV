# Light Sensor Array Arduino Codes:

There are two arduinos necessary for the light sensor array

The first arduino will have 13 photodiodes attached while the second only has 12 photodiodes.
It is VERY IMPORTANT to know which arduino has which photodiodes and what port they are on for the python code.
The .ino code is the same for both arduinos with the exception of the number of photodiodes. Please view the 
comments to see where the values should be changed in the code.

Thanks
