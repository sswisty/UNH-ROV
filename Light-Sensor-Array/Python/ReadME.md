# Light Sensor Array Python codes

The code with no beagle board combines the two codes developed by Firat for his PhD dissertation. The code saves a .txt file
of the photodiode readings.

The other codes are the codes from Firat's dissertation unedited. The beagle board gets the values from both arduinos and 
sends them to the computer where they're written into a .txt file
